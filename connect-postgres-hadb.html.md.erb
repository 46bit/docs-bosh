title: Connecting an External Postgres Database
---

The BOSH Director or MicroBOSH Director stores deployed VM status information in an internal or an external database. An internal database might be sufficient for your deployment; however, a highly-available external database can improve performance and scalability and protect against data loss. 

This topic describes how to connect BOSH or MicroBOSH to a highly-available external Postgres database.
 
 
##<a id="bosh"></a>BOSH ##

BOSH requires that you specify an internal MySQL or Postgres database or an external database.

The BOSH deployment manifest includes a `postgres` sub-block. To configure BOSH to use an external Postgres database, modify the manifest with your Postgres database connection information and redeploy.

To connect BOSH to an external Postgres database:

1. Record the hostname and port number of your Postgres database.
1. Open your BOSH deployment manifest in a text editor.
1. Locate and modify the `postgres` sub-block in the `properties` block. 

    Replace the existing user credentials, database host, and port number with your Postgres database connection information. Add the port number key/value pair if it does not exist.

    <pre class="terminal">
  properties:
     postgres: &amp;bosh&#95;db
       adapter: postgres
       user: USER&#95;NAME 
       password: PASSWORD 
       host: HOST&#95;NAME 
       port: PORT&#95;NUMBER
       database: bosh
   </pre>

1. Redeploy.


##<a id="microbosh"></a>MicroBOSH  

MicroBOSH uses an internal Postgres database by default. You can override this default in MicroBOSH by specifying an internal MySQL database or an external database.

By default, the MicroBOSH deployment manifest does not include a `postgres` sub-block. To configure MicroBOSH to use an external Postgres database, add a `postgres` sub-block to your deployment manifest and redeploy.
 
To connect MicroBOSH to an external Postgres database:

1. Record the hostname and port number of your Postgres database.
1. Open your MicroBOSH deployment manifest in a text editor and locate the `properties` sub-block in the `apply_spec` block.
1. Add the `postgres` sub-block to the `properties` sub-block.

    Replace the user credentials, database host, and port number with your Postgres database connection information. 

    <pre class="terminal">
apply&#95;spec:
...
  properties:
     postgres: &#38;bosh&#95;db
       adapter: postgres
       user: USER&#95;NAME
       password: PASSWORD
       host: HOST&#95;NAME
       port: PORT&#95;NUMBER
       database: bosh
   </pre>

1. Redeploy.
