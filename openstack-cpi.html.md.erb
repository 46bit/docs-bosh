title: OpenStack CPI
---

This topic describes cloud properties for different resources created by the OpenStack CPI.

## <a id='networks'></a> Networks

Schema for `cloud_properties` section used by dynamic network or manual network subnet:

* **net_id** [String, required]: Subnet ID in which the instance will be created. Example: `net-b98ab66e-6fae-4c6a-81af-566e630d21d1`.
* **security_groups** [Array, optional]: Array of security groups to apply for all VMs that are placed on this network. Defaults to security groups specified by `default_security_groups` in the global CPI settings.

Example of manual network:

```yaml
networks:
- name: default
  type: manual

  subnets:
  - range:   10.10.0.0/24
    gateway: 10.10.0.1
    cloud_properties:
      net_id: net-b98ab66e-6fae-4c6a-81af-566e630d21d1
      security_groups: [my-sec-group]
```

Example of dynamic network:

```yaml
networks:
- name: default
  type: dynamic
  cloud_properties:
    net_id: net-b98ab66e-6fae-4c6a-81af-566e630d21d1
```

Example of vip network:

```yaml
networks:
- name: default
  type: vip
  cloud_properties: {}
```

## <a id='resource-pools'></a> Resource pools

Schema for `cloud_properties` section:

* **instance_type** [String, required]: Type of the instance. Example: `m1.small`.
* **availability_zone** [String, required]: Availability zone to use for creating instances. Example: `us-east-1a`.
* **key_name** [String, optional]: Key pair name. Defaults to key pair name specified by `default_key_name` in the global CPI settings. Example: `bosh`.
* **scheduler_hints** [Hash, optional]: Data passed to the OpenStack Filter scheduler to influence its decision where new VMs can be placed. See [VM Anti-Affinity](vm-anti-affinity.html#openstack) for a detailed example. Example: `{ group: af09abf2-2283... }`

Example of a `m1.small` instance:

```yaml
resource_pools:
- name: default
  network: default
  stemcell:
    name: bosh-openstack-kvm-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent
    version: latest
  cloud_properties:
    instance_type: m1.small
    availability_zone: us-east-1a
```

## <a id='disk-pools'></a> Disk Pools

Schema for `cloud_properties` section:

* **type** [String, optional]: Volume type as configured in your OpenStack installation. Example: `SSD`

Cinder volumes are created in the availability zone of an instance that volume will be attached.

Example of 10GB SSD disk:

```yaml
disk_pools:
- name: default
  disk_size: 10_240
  cloud_properties:
    type: SSD
```

## <a id='errors'></a> Errors

```
Bosh::Clouds::VMCreationFailed
```

This error is raised if OpenStack is unable to create a VM. That may happen because:

- not enough resources (vCPUs, RAM, disk) to run the VM. For example if you have selected `m1.xlarge` flavor that uses 10 vCPUs and and you have 4 hypervisors and each one of them only has 3 vCPUs available, OpenStack is unable to start the VM anywhere even though, total vCPUs across all hypervisors is more than enough.
