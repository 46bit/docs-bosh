`login [USERNAME] [PASSWORD]`<br/>
Authenticates a user with the Director when you provide a username and password. Prompts for this information if you omit it.

`status [--uuid]`<br/>
Displays the configuration file and deployment manifest in use, and information about the BOSH Director such as name, URL, version, current username, UUID, and CPI.

---
### <a id="user"></a>Users

`create user [USERNAME] [PASSWORD]`<br/>

`releases [--jobs]`<br/>
Displays the list of available releases.

`upload release [RELEASE_FILE] [--rebase] [--skip-if-exists]`<br/>
Uploads the file that you specify as a release. If you do not provide a `RELEASE_FILE`, you must run this command from a valid release directory.

`delete release NAME [VERSION] [--force]`<br/>
Deletes a release and associated jobs, packages, compiled packages, and all package metadata. Fails if a deployment references this release.

---
### <a id="dir-stemcells"></a> Stemcells

`stemcells`<br/>
Displays the name, version, and CID of available stemcells.

`upload stemcell STEMCELL_LOCATION [--skip-if-exists]`<br/>
Uploads the stemcell that you specify. `STEMCELL_LOCATION` can be a local file path or a remote URL.

`delete stemcell NAME VERSION [--force]`<br/>
Deletes a stemcell and all associated compiled packages. Fails if any deployment references this stemcell.

`public stemcells [--full] [--all]`<br/>
Displays a list of available public stemcells. Alternatively use [BOSH Artifacts](http://bosh-artifacts.cfapps.io) to see all available stemcells.

`download public stemcell STEMCELL_FILENAME`<br/>
Downloads the stemcell that you specify from the public blobstore to the machine running the CLI.

---
### <a id="deployment"></a> Deployment

`deployments`<br/>
Displays the list of created deployments on the Director. Shows stemcells and releases used by each deployment.

`deployment [FILE_PATH]`<br/>
Switches the CLI to operate on the deployment specified by the deployment manifest `FILE_PATH`. Displays the current deployment if you omit `FILENAME`.

`deploy [--recreate]`<br/>
Creates/updates or recreates a deployment.

`download manifest DEPLOYMENT_NAME [FILE_PATH]`<br/>
Downloads and saves the deployment manifest of the deployment `DEPLOYMENT_NAME` to `FILE_PATH`.

`delete deployment DEPLOYMENT_NAME [--force]`<br/>
Deletes job instances, VMs, disks, snapshots, templates associated with the deployment `DEPLOYMENT_NAME`.

---
### <a id="health"></a> Job/VM Health

`vms [DEPLOYMENT_NAME] [--details] [--dns] [--vitals]`<br/>
Displays a table that provides an overview of the VMs in `DEPLOYMENT_NAME`. You can specify the following options:

- **Details**: Includes Cloud ID, Agent ID, and the status of the BOSH Resurrector for each VM.
- **DNS**: Includes the DNS A record for each VM.
- **Vitals**: Includes load, CPU, memory, swap, system disk, ephemeral disk, and persistent disk usage for each VM.

`recreate JOB [INDEX] [--force]`<br/>
Stops the job process, power cycles the VM, recreates the job instance, then restarts the job process.

`cck [DEPLOYMENT_NAME] [--auto] [--report]`<br/>
Scans for differences between the VM state database that the Director maintains and the actual state of the VMs. For each difference the scan detects, `bosh cck` offers possible repair options.

---
### <a id="tasks"></a> Director Tasks

`tasks [--no-filter] `<br/>
Displays a table that lists the following for all _currently running_ tasks: ID number, state, timestamp, user, description, and result.

`tasks recent [COUNT] [--no-filter]`<br/>
Displays a table that lists the following for the last `COUNT` tasks: ID number, state, timestamp, user, description, and result. `COUNT` defaults to 30.

`task [TASK_ID] [--event] [--cpi] [--debug] [--result] [--raw]`<br/>
Displays the status of a task that you specify and tracks its output. You can track only one of the following log types at a time: event, CPI, debug, or result. Defaults to event.

---
### <a id="ssh"></a> SSH

`ssh [--public_key FILE] [--gateway_host HOST] [--gateway_user USER] [--gateway_identity_file FILE] [--default_password PASSWORD]`<br/>
When you provide arguments with an option flag, the BOSH Director starts an interactive session, passing the specified arguments to a job VM. For example, `bosh ssh --public_key mykey.pub` instructs the BOSH Director to launch an interactive session with a job VM and pass the specified key to the VM.

`ssh JOB [INDEX] [COMMANDS]`<br/>
When you provide arguments without an option flag, the Director executes the arguments as commands on the job VM. For example, `bosh redis ssh ls -R` runs the `ls -R` command on the redis job VM.

### <a id="logs"></a> Logs

`logs JOB [INDEX] [--agent] [--job] [--only filter1,filter2,...] [--all] [--dir DESTINATION_DIRECTORY]`<br/>
