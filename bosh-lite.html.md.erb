title: BOSH Lite
---

BOSH Lite v2 is a Director VM running with VirtualBox managed via [CLI v2](cli-v2.html). It uses containers to emulate VMs which makes it an excellent choice for:

- General BOSH exploration without investing time and resources to configure an IaaS
- Development of releases (including BOSH itself)
- Testing releases locally or in CI

Follow [BOSH Lite on VirtualBox](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-deployment/blob/master/docs/bosh-lite-on-vbox.md) to set it up.

If you are looking for the original Vagrant based BOSH Lite, please refer to [cloudfoundry/bosh-lite's README](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite).
