title: BOSH Workflow
---

While the distributed software you use BOSH to deploy can be complex, the basic patterns for working with BOSH are not.

## <a id="options"></a> Options for Deploying BOSH  ##

Before you use BOSH to deploy software, how do you deploy BOSH itself?

You have several options.

1. BOSH Lite is software that runs within a single VM.
Scripts packaged with BOSH Lite make deploying it simpler than deploying a normal ("full") BOSH.

1. _other option_

only in AWS:
bosh aws create
bosh aws bootstrap micro bosh aws bootstrap bosh
or generate for manifests only instead of bootstrap

minimal example:
deploy BOSH with MicroBOSH

## <a id="before"></a> Before Deploying, Obtain the Stemcell, Release and Manifest  ##

Before you deploy, you must have:

* A **release** that has the software products and services you want.
You can obtain a release from a software provider, or create one yourself.

* A **stemcell** appropriate to the cloud infrastructure and OS where you plan to deploy.
You obtain a stemcell from Pivotal Network.

* A **manifest** that accounts for environmental constraints and specifies how you want to orchestrate your deployment.
You can modify an example manifest to suit your purposes, or use a tool like spiff to create a manifest.

## <a id="deploying"></a> Deploying Software with BOSH  ##

To deploy software with BOSH, you perform four steps:

1. Upload stemcell.
1. Upload release.
1. Set deployment with a manifest.
1. Deploy.

This pattern is at the heart of the BOSH workflow, and its power is in simplicity.
Without it, you would likely need to perform a larger number of tasks, many of them difficult to replicate from deployment to deployment.
Because deploying software is an iterative process, the amount of labor that this pattern saves is significant.

Other activities typical of the care and feeding of distributed software deployments include:

* Creating and editing users
* Inspecting the state of VMs
* Getting (viewing) and sometimes cancelling Director tasks

You perform these activities before or after deployment, or both.
