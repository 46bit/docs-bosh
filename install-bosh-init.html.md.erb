title: Install bosh-init
---

bosh-init is used for creating and updating a Director VM (and its persistent disk) in an environment.

It is written in Go and comes as a single binary. Here are latest versions:

* bosh-init for Linux (amd64)
* bosh-init for Mac OS X (amd64)
* bosh-init is not supported on Windows

Once you download the binary, place it on your `PATH`. For example on UNIX machines:

<pre class="terminal">
$ chmod +x ~/Downloads/bosh-init-X-linux
$ sudo mv ~/Downloads/bosh-init-X-linux /usr/local/bin/bosh-init
</pre>

To make sure bosh-init is properly installed, check its version:

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh-init -v
</pre>
