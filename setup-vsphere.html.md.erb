title: Setting Up vSphere for BOSH
---

This topic explains how to prepare vSphere for deploying BOSH or MicroBOSH.

##<a id="hardware"></a>Step 1: Allocate Hardware Resources ##

Your intended use of BOSH determines what hardware resources you should allocate
in your IaaS.

For example:

* BOSH needs room to store the releases it deploys.
Larger applications or larger numbers of applications require more disk space.
* Larger numbers of active users require more RAM.

vSphere describes hardware in terms of RAM, CPU, virtual disk, and other specs.
Refer to the [hardware requirements](../deploying/vsphere/hardware_spec.html)
for Cloud Foundry topic for help deciding what hardware to use.

##<a id="traffic"></a>Step 2: Restrict Network Traffic ##

To restrict incoming network traffic to the BOSH VMs on vSphere:

1. Deploy BOSH and your applications deployed with BOSH to separate private
networks.

1. Route requests to BOSH or your applications from a router or load balancer on
a public network.

Isolating BOSH and your applications in this way increase security and allows
your to use as many IP addresses as you need by adding subnets to the private
networks.

One way to accomplish this is to configure Network Address Translation (NAT) on a VM.
Assign two network adapters to the VM.
This results in the VM having two IP addresses:

* A public-facing IP address: This IP address connects to the public network
VLAN though an external gateway IP address.
* An internal VLAN IP address: This IP address connects to BOSH and your
application VMs through an internal gateway IP address.
