BOSH installs and updates software packages on large numbers of VMs over many IaaS providers with the absolute minimum of configuration changes.

BOSH orchestrates initial deployments and ongoing updates that are:

* Predictable, repeatable, and reliable
* Self-healing
* Infrastructure-agnostic

BOSH works on multiple IaaS offerings including AWS, Open Stack, and vSphere,
freeing operators from concerns about differences between environments.
