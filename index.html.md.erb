BOSH is an open source tool chain for working with large-scale distributed
services.
BOSH provides artifacts, abstractions and processes that coordinate the
efforts of developers, release engineers, cloud operators, and network
and system administrators.

A BOSH release easily combines in-house source code with off-the-shelf
source and binaries.
Developers benefit from a self-service model for testing code, and
deployments and updates are predictable and repeatable.

BOSH strives to make all operations infrastructure-agnostic and to
abstract away differences between development, testing, and production
environments.
Applications deployed with BOSH remain optimally stable and robust
despite being run on ephemeral large-scale cloud resources.

Once you are familiar with the Foundations material,
refer to other topics according to what
you need to do with BOSH.
