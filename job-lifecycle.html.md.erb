title: Job Lifecycle
---

There are several stages that each job goes through during a deployment process:

1. release job and its dependent packages are downloaded and placed on a machine
1. [pre-start scripts](pre-start.html) run for all jobs on the VM in parallel
	- (waits for all pre-start scripts to finish)
1. `monit start` is called for each process
1. [post-start scripts](post-start.html) run for all jobs on the VM in parallel
	- (waits for all post-start scripts to finish)
1. [post-deploy scripts](post-deploy.html) run for all jobs on *all* VMs in parallel
	- (waits for all post-deploy scripts to finish)
1. monit will automatically restart processes that exited
1. `monit unmonitor` is called for each process
1. [drain scripts](drain.html) run for all jobs on the VM
	- (waits for all drain scripts to finish)
1. `monit stop` is called for each process
