## Debugging Director database

Rarely it's necessary to dive into the Director DB. The easiest way to do so is to SSH into the Director VM and use `director_ctl console`. For example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ ssh vcap@DIRECTOR-IP

$ /var/vcap/jobs/director/bin/director_ctl console
=> Loading /var/vcap/jobs/director/config/director.yml
=> ruby-debug not found, debugger disabled
=> Welcome to BOSH Director console
=> You can use 'app' to access REST API
=> You can also use 'cloud', 'blobstore', 'nats' helpers to query these services
irb(main):001:0> Bosh::Director::Models::RenderedTemplatesArchive.count
=> 3
</pre>

<p class="note">Note: It's not recommended to modify the Director database via this or other manual methods. Please let us know via GitHub issue if you need a certain feature in the BOSH CLI to do some operation.</p>
