title: MicroBOSH Deployment Manifest Example for AWS
---


Now letâ€™s review what the contents of the `microbosh.yml` deployment
manifest file should include. If you did not use the us-east-1a
availability zone, you will need to adjust that. We are using a small instance type for the Micro BOSH. Be sure to replace "x.x.x.x" with
the IP address you created in [Configuring AWS for Micro BOSH](./configure_aws_micro_bosh.html) and make sure to replace the AWS access credentials with your own.

~~~yaml
name: microbosh

logging:
  level: DEBUG

network:
  type: dynamic
  vip: x.x.x.x    #Change this to the allocated IP address from Step 2

resources:
  persistent_disk: 20000
  cloud_properties:
    instance_type: m1.small
    availability_zone: us-east-1a

cloud:
  plugin: aws
  properties:
    aws:
      access_key_id: AKIAIYJWVDUP4KRESQ
      secret_access_key: EVGFswlmOvA33ZrU1ViFEtXC5Sugc19yPzoWRf
      default_key_name: bosh
      default_security_groups: ["bosh"]
      ec2_private_key: ~/.ssh/bosh
      ec2_endpoint: ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
      region: us-east-1

apply_spec:
  agent:
    blobstore:
      address: x.x.x.x    #Change this to the allocated IP address from Step 2
    nats:
      address: x.x.x.x    #Change this to the allocated IP address from Step 2
  properties:
    aws_registry:
      address: x.x.x.x    #Change this to the allocated IP address from Step 2
~~~

If you are using the sample manifest provided, confirm the following:

1. Make sure to update all of the instances of x.x.x.x IP with the appropriate elastic IP you created.

2. Add the AWS credentials under the AWS section.

3. Verify the AWS region added in the manifest.

Save your changes to the file.
