title: Uploading Stemcells
---

(See [What is a Stemcell?](stemcell.html) for an introduction to stemcells.)

As described earlier, each resource pool references a specific stemcell on the Director. Before the Director can form a deployment, all referenced stemcells must be uploaded to the Director.

## <a id='find'></a> Finding Official Stemcells

You can download stemcells from two official sources:

- [BOSH Artifacts site](http://bosh-artifacts.cfapps.io/)
- Using the `public stemcells` command

    To list the latest public stemcells:

    <pre class="terminal">
    bosh public stemcells

    +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
    | Name                                                            |
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
    | bosh-stemcell-2751-aws-xen-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent.tgz           |
    | bosh-stemcell-2751-openstack-kvm-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent.tgz     |
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------+

    To download use `bosh download public stemcell <stemcell_name>'. For full url use --full.
    </pre>

    And to download the listed public stemcell into the `~/Downloads` directory:

    <pre class="terminal">
    cd ~/Downloads
    bosh download public stemcell bosh-stemcell-2751-aws-xen-hvm-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent.tgz
    </pre>

---
## <a id='upload'></a> Uploading to the Director

Assuming the CLI is already targeted at the Director, the CLI provides a single command to upload a stemcell:

<pre class="terminal">
bosh upload stemcell ~/Downloads/bosh-stemcell-2751-aws-xen-hvm-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent.tgz --skip-if-exists
</pre>

Once the command succeeds you can view all uploaded stemcells in the Director:

<pre class="terminal">
bosh stemcells

+-----------------------------------------+---------+--------------+
| Name                                    | Version | CID          |
+-----------------------------------------+---------+--------------+
| bosh-aws-xen-hvm-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent | 2751    | ami-cc27a1a4 |
| bosh-aws-xen-centos-go_agent            | 2710    | ami-a0a674c8 |
+-----------------------------------------+---------+--------------+

(*) Currently in-use

Stemcells total: 2
</pre>

## <a id='using'></a> Deployment Manifest Usage

To use uploaded stemcell in your deployment, stemcell needs to be referenced by one of the resource pools:

```yaml
resource_pools:
- name: redis-servers
  network: default

  # Assocition with Ubuntu Trusty stemcell for AWS
  stemcell:
    name: bosh-aws-xen-hvm-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent
    version: 2751

  cloud_properties: {instance_type: m1.medium}
```
