title: Uploading Stemcells
---

<p class="note">Note: Applies to CLI v2.</p>

(See [What is a Stemcell?](stemcell.html) for an introduction to stemcells.)

As described earlier, each resource pool references a specific stemcell on the Director. Before the Director can form a deployment, all referenced stemcells must be uploaded to the Director.

## <a id='find'></a> Finding Stemcells

The [stemcells section of bosh.io](http://bosh.io/stemcells) lists official stemcells.

## <a id='upload'></a> Uploading to the Director

Assuming the CLI is already targeted at the Director, the CLI provides a single command to upload a stemcell.

- If you have a URL to a stemcell tarball (for example URL provided by bosh.io):

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh upload-stemcell URL --sha1 SHA1
    </pre>

- If you have a stemcell tarball on your local machine:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh upload-stemcell ~/Downloads/bosh-stemcell-3421.4-warden-boshlite-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent.tgz
    </pre>

Once the command succeeds you can view all uploaded stemcells in the Director:

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh -e vbox stemcells
Using environment '192.168.50.6' as client 'admin'

Name                                         Version  OS             CPI  CID
bosh-warden-boshlite-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent  3421.4*  ubuntu-trusty  -    6c9c002e-bb46-4838-4b73-ff1afaa0aa21

## <a id='using'></a> Deployment Manifest Usage

```yaml
