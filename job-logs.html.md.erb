title: Location and use of logs
---

This topic describes different types of logs for BOSH jobs and errands and how you access and view them.

## <a id="jobs-logging"></a> Job Logging

You can access logs by two methods:

 * Using the `bosh ssh` command to SSH into a VM and look at the log files.
 * Using the `bosh logs` command to download logs from the VM.

The following sections describe different types of logs.

### <a id="jobs-logs"></a> Job Logs

Release jobs on VMs produce logs throughtout different lifecycle events. Release authors are strongly encouraged to place release job logs into `/var/vcap/sys/log/<release_job_name>/*.log`, providing a consistent place for the operator to find them.

For example `redis-server` release job will create two log files:

- `/var/vcap/sys/log/redis-server/redis-server.stdout.log`
- `/var/vcap/sys/log/redis-server/redis-server.stderr.log`

To download logs from all release jobs from a specific instance, run `bosh logs <job_name> <index>`.

#### <a id="log-rotation"></a> Log Rotation

BOSH log rotates release job logs with the [Logrotate](http://linuxconfig.org/logrotate) log file management utility. BOSH instructs Logrotate to act on all `.log` files in the `/var/vcap/sys/log/`, `/var/vcap/sys/log/*/`, and `/var/vcap/sys/log/*/*/` directories.

Logrotate is configured by the Agent and runs automatically with the following non-configurable settings:

* `missingok`: Skip missing log files and do not generate an error message
* `rotate 7`: Keep seven log files at a time
* `compress`: Compress old log files with gzip
* `delaycompress`: Postpone compression of log files until the next rotation cycle
* `copytruncate`: Copy log files, then truncate in place instead of creating new files
* `size 50M`: Rotate log files when they exceed 50 MB in size

### <a id="monit-logs"></a> Monit Logs

The Agent uses Monit to start, restart, and stop release job processes as specified by the release jobs. Monit detects errors and outputs often useful information to its log. Use `tail` to examine the `monit.log` on a VM:

<pre class="terminal">
$ sudo tail -f -n 200 /var/vcap/monit/monit.log
</pre>

### <a id="agent-logs"></a> Agent Logs

Agent logs contain configuration and runtime information from the Agent running on a VM. Review these logs if the Director sees VM as unresponsive or the Director fails to contact it during its creation.

The Agent stores logs in `/var/vcap/bosh/log/` and outputs most recent content to `/var/vcap/bosh/log/current`.

<pre class="terminal">
$ sudo tail -f -n 200 /var/vcap/bosh/log/current
</pre>

## <a id="errand-logs"></a>Errand Logging ##

BOSH names logs using the errand name and log type, and writes the logs to the `/var/vcap/sys/log/<errand-name>` directory.
For example, BOSH writes the stdout log for an errand named "smoke-test" to `/var/vcap/sys/log/smoke-test/smoke-test.stdout.log`.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Since BOSH deletes the VM when an errand completes, you cannot access full logs after errand completes.</p>

By default, the CLI outputs errand's output to the screen when it's smaller than 1MB. If you expect errand to generate output larger than 1MB, currently it needs to be redirected to a file and then downloaded.

To save output from a BOSH errand VM:

1. In the errand run script, redirect the output to a log.
1. Using the CLI, run `bosh run errand X` with the `--download-logs` option to download the logs.

    By default, BOSH downloads the logs to your present working directory. Use the `--logs-dir destination_directory` option to change this directory.

<pre class="terminal">
$ run errand smoke-tests --download-logs --logs-dir ~/workspace/smoke-tests-logs
</pre>

## <a id="director-logs"></a> Director Task Logs

When you run a BOSH command using the [CLI](./bosh-cli.html), the Director stores all activities for the specific command in a task log. Review these logs when you experience an issue with a BOSH command.

To access Director task logs:

1. Run `bosh tasks recent` to find the task number of the failed command.
1. Run `bosh task <task_number>`.
