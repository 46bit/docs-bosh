## <a id='console'></a>From the Cloud Foundry Deployment Manifest ##

The manifest used to deploy your Cloud Foundry instance specifies properties for
the cloud controller.
The value of one of these properties, `domain`, is appended to the string
**api.** to form the API endpoint for your Cloud Foundry instance.

For example, if your Cloud Foundry deployment manifest specifies the `domain`
property for your cloud controller as **sample.com**, the API endpoint is
**api.sample.com**.
