The Director is primarily used for managing deployments.

Creation of a deployment consists of the following steps:

- create deployment manifest
- upload stemcells and releases used by the manifest
- kick off the deploy to form a deployment on the Director

Updating an existing deployment is effectively the same procedure:

- update deployment manifest with necessary changes
- upload new stemcells and/or releses
- kick off the deploy to apply changes

All of the steps above are done with a regular editor and via the BOSH CLI.
