## BOSH Glossary

The intent of the BOSH glossary is to crystallize and define the terms of the "language" used within BOSH teams.

# Agent

The sense of the noun "agent" in the context of BOSH differs from ordinary usage.

The BOSH agent is a constantly running process in VMs deployed by BOSH. The Agent receives messages from the BOSH Director and executes tasks.

# Blobstore

The Blobstore is a repository where BOSH stores binary content at various times in the lifecycle of a BOSH release.

# Deploy

The sense of the verb "deploy" in the context of BOSH differs from ordinary usage. 

BOSH uses a manifest, a release, and a stemcell together to deploy software to the cloud. 

# Deployment

The sense of the noun "deployment" in the context of BOSH differs from ordinary usage.

BOSH creates a stable deployment using ephemeral resources. The deployment can be replicated and re-deployed on different infrastructure than where it was deployed the first.

# Director

The sense of the noun "director" in the context of BOSH differs from ordinary usage.

The BOSH director is the orchestrator of a BOSH deployment. It coordinates the various BOSH agents and responds to user requests and system events.

# Release

The sense of the noun "release" in the context of BOSH differs from ordinary usage.

A BOSH release is the collected configuration, instructions, jobs, tasks, and packages needed to make a software component deployable by BOSH.

# Stemcell

The sense of the noun "stemcell" in the context of BOSH differs from ordinary usage.

A BOSH stemcell is a generic VM image that BOSH uses as a template and instantiates and configures to realize the VMs required for a specific deployment.

# Task

The sense of the noun "task" in the context of BOSH differs from ordinary usage.

A singular unit of work that BOSH performs. It has a clear lifecycle (e.g., started, running, ended, failed) and a BOSH user can monitor and get statuses and logs for all tasks.

# MicroBOSH

An essentially complete BOSH that runs within a single VM is called a MicroBOSH. The role of the MicroBOSH is to orchestrate the deployment of BOSH. 

# Job

The sense of the noun "job" in the context of BOSH differs from ordinary usage.

BOSH aggregates multiple tasks into a single job. Each job usually maps to a goal ... multiple jobs in a release ... 

# Jumpbox

A VM that acts as a single access point for the VMs in a BOSH deployment and its VMs.

# CPI

Cloud Provider Interface is the layer between BOSH and an IaaS (cloud).

# Manifest

A manifest is a YAML file that identifies a release and a stemcell and specifies how they are configured in a given deployment.
