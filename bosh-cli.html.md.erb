title: BOSH Command Line Interface
---

**NOTE**: The latest patch of Ruby 1.9.3 is a prerequisite for installing the BOSH CLI. Ruby 2.x is not supported.

The BOSH Command Line Interface (CLI) is a command line interface used to interact with MicroBOSH and BOSH.
Before you can use MicroBOSH or BOSH, you need to install the BOSH CLI.

Run this command to install BOSH CLI with the MicroBOSH plugin:

`gem install bosh_cli bosh_cli_plugin_micro`

Use the following command to consult the BOSH CLI help:

`bosh help --all`
