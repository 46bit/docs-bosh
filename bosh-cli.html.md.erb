title: BOSH Command Line Interface
---

BOSH Command Line Interface (CLI) is used to interact with the Director and to bootstrap new BOSH environments. The CLI is written in Ruby and is provided by the two gems:

* `bosh_cli` contains main operator commands [<img src="https://badge.fury.io/rb/bosh_cli.png" />]
* `bosh_cli_plugin_micro` contains bootstrapping commands [<img src="https://badge.fury.io/rb/bosh_cli_plugin_micro.png" />]

To install both of these gems:

<pre class="terminal">
$ gem install bosh_cli bosh_cli_plugin_micro --no-ri --no-rdoc
</pre>

<p class='note'>Note: Installing the BOSH CLI requires Ruby 2+</p>

Use the following command to consult the BOSH CLI help and to verify that CLI can run:

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh help
</pre>

### Prerequisites on CentOS

Make sure following packages are installed:

<pre class="terminal">
$ sudo yum install gcc ruby ruby-devel mysql-devel postgresql-devel postgresql-libs sqlite-devel libxslt-devel libxml2-devel yajl-ruby
</pre>

### Prerequisites on Mac OS X

You may see an error like this:
<strong>The compiler failed to generate an executable file. (RuntimeError)
<br>
You have to install development tools first.
</strong>

Make sure you have installed Xcode and the command-line developer tools, and agreed to the license.

<pre class="terminal">
$ xcode-select --install
xcode-select: note: install requested for command line developer tools
$
</pre>

A window will pop up saying:
<strong>The "xcode-select" command requires the command line developer tools. Would you like to install the tools now?</strong>
Choose Install to continue. Choose Get Xcode to install Xcode and the command line developer tools from the App Store.
If you have already installed Xcode from the App Store, you can choose Install and it will install the cli tools.

If you have successfully installed them, you will see this:

<pre class="terminal">
$ xcode-select --install
xcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, use "Software Update" to install updates
$
</pre>

To agree to the license:

<pre class="terminal">
$ sudo xcodebuild -license


You have not agreed to the Xcode license agreements. You must agree to both license agreements below in order to use Xcode.

</pre>

This plugin has been originally designed for quickly bootstrapping AWS development environments. It does not provide extensible configuration options.
