title: BOSH Command Line Interface
---

**NOTE**: The latest patch of Ruby 1.9.3 is a prerequisite for installing the BOSH CLI. Ruby 2.x is not supported.

The BOSH Command Line Interface (CLI) is a required tool for interacting with MicroBOSH and BOSH.

Run this command to install BOSH CLI with the MicroBOSH plugin:

`gem install bosh_cli bosh_cli_plugin_micro`

Use the following command to consult the BOSH CLI help:

`bosh help --all`
