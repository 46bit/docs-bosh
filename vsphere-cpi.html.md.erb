title: vSphere CPI
---

This topic describes cloud properties for different resources created by the vSphere CPI.

## <a id='networks'></a> Networks

Schema for `cloud_properties` section used by manual network subnet:

* **name** [String, required]: Name of the vSphere network. Example: `VM Network`.

Example of manual network:

```yaml
networks:
- name: default
  type: manual

  subnets:
  - range:   10.10.0.0/24
    gateway: 10.10.0.1
    cloud_properties:
      name: VM Network
```

vSphere CPI does not support dynamic or vip networks.

## <a id='resource-pools'></a> Resource Pools

Schema for `cloud_properties` section:

* **cpu** [Integer, required]: Number of CPUs. Example: `1`.
* **ram** [Integer, required]: RAM in megabytes. Example: `1024`.
* **disk** [Integer, required]: Ephemeral disk size in megabytes. Example: `10240`.
* **nested_hardware_virtualization** [Boolean, optional]: Exposes hardware assisted virtualization to the VM. Default: `false`.

* **datacenters** [Array, optional]: Array of datacenters to use for VM placement. Must have only one and it must match datacenter configured in global CPI options.
    * **name** [String, required]: Datacenter name.
    * **clusters** [Array, required]: Array of clusters to use for VM placement.
        * **\<cluster name\>** [String, required]: Cluster name.
            * **drs_rulers** [Array, optional]: Array of DRS rules applied to [constrain VM placement](vm-anti-affinity.html#vsphere). Must have only one.
                * **name** [String, required]: Name of a DRS rule that the Director will create.
                * **type** [String, required]: Type of a DRS rule. Currently only `separate_vms` is supported.

Example of a VM with 1 CPU, 1GB RAM, and 10GB ephemeral disk asked to be placed into a specific cluster:

```yaml
resource_pools:
- name: default
  network: default
  stemcell:
    name: bosh-vsphere-esxi-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent
    version: latest
  cloud_properties:
    cpu: 2
    ram: 1_024
    disk: 10_240

    datacenters:
    - {name: my-dc, clusters: [my-vsphere-cluster]}
```

And an example of a VM asked to be placed into a specific cluster in a specified vSphere resource pool:

```yaml
resource_pools:
- name: default
  network: default
  stemcell:
    name: bosh-vsphere-esxi-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent
    version: latest
  cloud_properties:
    cpu: 2
    ram: 1_024
    disk: 10_240

    datacenters:
    - name: my-dc
      clusters:
      - my-vsphere-cluster: {resource_pool: my-vsphere-res-pool}
```

## <a id='disk-pools'></a> Disk Pools

Currently the CPI does not support any cloud properties for disks.

Example of 10GB disk:

```yaml
disk_pools:
- name: default
  disk_size: 10_240
```

---
## <a id='global'></a> Global Configuration

The CPI can only talk to a single vCenter installation and manage VMs within a single vSphere datacenter.

Schema:

* **host** [String, required]: IP address of the vCenter. Example: `172.16.68.3`.
* **user** [String, required]: Username for the API access. Example: `root`.
* **password** [String, required]: Password for the API access. Example: `vmware`

* **datacenters** [Array, optional]: Array of datacenters to use for VM placement. Must have only one.
    * **name** [String, required]: Datacenter name.

    * **vm_folder** [String, required]: Path to a folder (relative to the datacenter) for storing created VMs. Folder will be automatically created if not found.
    * **template_folder** [String, required]: Path to a folder (relative to the datacenter) for storing uploaded stemcells. Folder will be automatically created if not found.
    * **disk_path** [String, required]: Path to a *disk* folder for storing persistent disks. Folder will be automatically created in the datastore if not found.

    * **datastore_pattern** [String, required]: Pattern for selecting datastores for storing ephemeral disks and replicated stemcells.
    * **persistent\_datastore\_pattern** [String, required]: Pattern for selecting datastores for storing persistent disks.
    * **allow\_mixed\_datastores** [Boolean, optional]: Flag to indicate if `datastore_pattern` and `persistent_datastore_pattern` can reference same datastores.

    * **clusters** [Array, required]: Array of clusters to use for VM placement.
        * **\<cluster name\>** [String, required]: Cluster name.
            * **resource_pool** [String, optional]: Specific vSphere resource pool to use within the cluster.

Example of a CPI configuration that will place VMs into `BOSH_CL` cluster within `BOSH_DC`:

```yaml
# ...snip...

  host: 172.16.68.3
  user: root
  password: vmware

  datacenters:
  - name: BOSH_DC
    vm_folder: prod-vms
    template_folder: prod-templates
    disk_path: prod-disks

    datastore_pattern: '\Aprod-ds\z'
    persistent_datastore_pattern: '\Aprod-ds\z'
    allow_mixed_datastores: true

    clusters: [BOSH_CL]
```

Or example that places VMs by default into `BOSH_RP` vSphere resource pool:

```yaml
# ...snip...

  host: 172.16.68.3
  user: root
  password: vmware

  datacenters:
  - name: BOSH_DC
    vm_folder: prod-vms
    template_folder: prod-templates
    disk_path: prod-disks

    datastore_pattern: '\Aprod-ds\z'
    persistent_datastore_pattern: '\Aprod-ds\z'
    allow_mixed_datastores: true

    clusters:
    - BOSH_CL: {resource_pool: BOSH_RP}
```

## <a id='notes'></a> Notes

* Assigned VM names (e.g. `vm-8dg349-s7cn74-...`) should not be manually changed since the CPI uses them to find created VMs. You can use [`bosh vms --details`](sysadmin-commands.html#health) to find which VM is assigned which job. VMs are also tagged with their assigned job, index and deployment.

* Storage DRS is not supported since it moves and renames persistent disks without maintaining same names.

---
## <a id='errors'></a> Errors

```
Field object_set is not optional
```

This error may occur when global CPI configuration references a cluster name (via `clusters` key) that cannot be found in the datacenter. Double check in vSphere that cluster exists.
